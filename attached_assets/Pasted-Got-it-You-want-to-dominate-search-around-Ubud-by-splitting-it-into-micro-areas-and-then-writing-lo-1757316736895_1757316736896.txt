Got it. You want to dominate search around Ubud by splitting it into micro-areas and then writing location-specific landing pages like “Massage in Penestanan Ubud” or “Home Massage in Nyuh Kuning”. That’s smart SEO, because tourists search with area names when they’re booking villas.

Here’s how you can structure it:

⸻

Step 1 – Core Areas of Ubud

Ubud isn’t just one town. It’s a cluster of villages and neighborhoods. The key ones people actually mention when booking villas are:
	•	Ubud Center (Monkey Forest, Jalan Raya Ubud, Hanoman Street, Dewi Sita, Jl. Suweta)
	•	Penestanan (west of center, known for artist villages, rice fields)
	•	Sayan (luxury villas along Ayung River valley)
	•	Nyuh Kuning (behind Monkey Forest, peaceful village vibe)
	•	Pengosekan (south of center, yoga and artsy area)
	•	Petulu (north of Ubud, famous for heron birds)
	•	Tegalalang (rice terrace area, many boutique stays)
	•	Pejeng (east side, historic temples, more local vibe)
	•	Kedewatan (northwest, many 5-star resorts overlooking Ayung River)
	•	Mas (village of woodcarvers, south of Ubud)
	•	Lodtunduh (southern entry into Ubud, villas in rice fields)

That’s 10 solid areas. Each one can have its own 200-word SEO page.

⸻

Step 2 – Page Structure (200 words each)

Each “area page” should:
	1.	Introduce the vibe (what makes the area special).
	2.	Connect massage to that vibe (why home massage is perfect in villas there).
	3.	Add keywords: “home massage,” “villa massage,” “Ubud,” plus the exact area name.
	4.	Call to action: Book your villa massage in [area].
